This is my first step. Many are to come. Power comes from iterative strength, not chaos. BELIEVE IT! 
# Naruto-Bridge
## Naruto-Bridge → TRON

Naruto-Bridge is the **local bridge**: a JSON-driven personal game engine that runs on a single machine and expresses a player’s private universe.

TRON is the **shared destination**: an online meta-universe where many Naruto-Bridge instances (called *Shards*) can eventually connect, expose parts of their worlds, and contribute to a larger grid.

Every Naruto-Bridge config is a potential **TRON Shard**. Even when offline, each Shard tracks:
- Its own identity
- The shape of its universe
- A log of “mining events” where the player defines that universe under constraints

When TRON exists as a network, these Shards will already know how to talk to it.
